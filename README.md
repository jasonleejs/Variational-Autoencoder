# Variational Autoencoder using PyTorch

### Introduction
This repository provides an two implementations of variational autoencoders:

1) `VAE`: Uses standard fully-connected neuron layers. 
2) `ConvVAE`: Uses convolutional encoding and decoding layers to capture spatial information. 

This repository also showcases an application of the variational autoencoder using the famous EMNIST dataset.

1) `VAE_MLP.ipynb` trains the standard MLP VAE.
2) `VAE_CNN.ipynb` trains the CNN VAE.
